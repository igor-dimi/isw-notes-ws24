Core goals of software engineering:

* **quality**: software fulfills the requirements  $\Leftarrow$ **this**
* **users**: software is useful for the users
* **developers**: it is easy to develop, maintain and modify the software
* **cost / time**: software can be implemented within the given cost & time constraints $\Rightarrow$ project management

Main task categories of software engineering:

* Development:
  * Determining the software context 
  * requirements engineering
  * architecture
  * detailed design
  * implementation
  * configuration management
* Quality management
  * product: testing, inspection, metrics
  * process: measurements, improvements
* Evolution:
  * maintenance
  * further development / modification
  * re-engineering / change management
* Project management:
  * team
  * costs
  * time / deadlines
  * risks
  * contractor / client
